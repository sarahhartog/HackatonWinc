            <h1>The pro's and con's of the fashion industry</h1>
            <p>Have you ever wonderd what it's like to be a model? I get a lot of questions about the luxury life, the
                money
                and the eating disorders you can get as a model. Let me awnser some of these questions. These are my
                stories and
                opinions, so feel free to leave a respectable comment in case you want to talk about it or start a
                discussion.</p>

        <div>
            <p class="p">There are so many contradictions in the modeling industry. I feel that you really need te be solid as a person to handle this job. This is because the fact that the industry is constantly asking you to be this way or that way and judging you all the time, really can take it's toll if you feel no confidence. For the one job you are too skinny and for the next you are to big. On this job you have to be more smiling, while the next client asks you to look fierce and powerfull. If you're able to don't take this personally, you'll be fine!</p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div>
            <p class="p">I love to go travel on the job. I get to see so many beautiful and interesting places all over the world. It feels really special to get to know so many people, sometimes I even make new friends and learn about their cultures. </p>
        </div>

        <br>

        <div>
            <p class="p">Over the past years I have been working as a model, I experienced alot of problems with feeling good about eating, not putting pressure on my diet and not getting scared of gaining weight. I don't think I met one model who never felt the same struggle about their measurements and diet. But I have learned one thing: <br>
            Some days I can feel so fit and I'm happy when I look in the mirror. If I would have to guess, I think I might be just under my normal measurements. (Which, unfortunately feels as a good thing in this industry). But when I measure myself, I'm over my usual centimeters around the hips.<br>
        And there are days, for example when my period is coming up, I feel so bloated and fat. But then I do my measurements and I'm skinnier than usual. So what I'm trying to say here is, it's not about those measurements that's most important, it's about how I feel! If you feel great, you look great in the pictures. </p>

        <div>
            <p class="p">When I first started modeling, I was signed with an agency in Milan and went there to live in their modelappartment for a year. After a few months I started to feel manupilated and lied to by this agency and I have never felt so unhappy. As most models start at young age, it's really easy to fall into the responsibilty of the wrong people. <br>
            When I lived in Milan, I went to gym almost every day, but as my body was only 18 years old, I could lose more weigth naturally. I started to feel depressed and struggling with eating disorder. I felt no help from my agency and in fact, they kept on pushing me to lose more weight. They said 'you look chubby'. Just for your picture: I was a size XS/S and only ate half a broccoli at night. This agency stopped giving my pocket money, as they said I didn't do my workout as I was supposed to by our contract. So they let me live on only â‚¬4 a day... I felt horrible and they didn't let me go home, as they kept telling me I had options for the next weeks. <br>
        What I learned here: Make sure you sign with a good agency! You should never be in dept from the first day on, they should always help you on feeling great and being able to do your job.<br>
    I'm signed with The Movement Models since 2019 and I just love them so much. They support me, make me feel amazing, take me serious and give me the best clients and jobs. I would love to tell you their story, so please check out this page on <a href="https://themovementmodels.com/models/sarah/">The Movement Models.</a></p>
